# InfluxDB

### What is influx?
Simplified: a time-series database. You send a few values over time and influx takes care of it. It’s extremely useful to store sensor measurement data from as example: a smart home instance.

Different influx versions:
There are versions before 1.8 after (well no shit sherlock) in the version before you can’t use the FLUX query language. And after the version, the databases are called buckets and some stuff got a bit confusing. And after all, for a small home lab setup, it’s enough and behind a firewall, it should also be secure. I personally prefer influx 1.8 over the other versions because of the simple set-up.

### Install on Ubuntu:
[Documentation and Source](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/introduction/install/)
1. ```wget -q https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key```

2. ``` echo '23a1c8836f0afc5ed24e0486339d7cc8f6790b83886c4c96995b88a061c5bb5d influxdb.key' | sha256sum -c && cat influxdb.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdb.gpg > /dev/null```

3. ``` echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdb.gpg] https://repos.influxdata.com/debian stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdata.list```

4. ``` sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install influxdb```

5. ``` sudo service influxdb start```

6. ``` sudo service influxdb status```

7. ``` sudo systemctl enable influxdb```


### Configuration:
[Documentation and Source](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/administration/authentication_and_authorization/#admin-users)
First type ```influx``` as a command, then a shell should launch.

Then to create an admin user type``` CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'yourPassword' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES```

To create a DB: ```CREATE DATABASE DBNAME```

To delete a DB: ```DROP DATABASE DBNAME```

You can exit the shell with ```quit```

There are a few settings to play within the config file which is located at: ```/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf```

As an example:  under ```[http]```, ```flux-enabled = false``` uncomment (remove the # in front) and set it to ```true``` and then you can send flux queries to the API endpoint. Or also under ```[http]```, ``` auth-enabled = false``` for authentication. Or enable UDP endpoint under ```[[udp]]```.

A tutorial on how to use Grafana in combination with influx will follow.

Stay amazing.
