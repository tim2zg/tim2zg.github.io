# This is my first blog post.
## Why did I create a blog? There are a few reasons:
1. I want to learn how GitHub Pages work.
2. I want to improve my English writing.
3. I want to share the little experiences that I got from my Projects with you all.
4. And the last point, I want to write my opinion about a few topics.

I mainly want to write about questions I had during programming which took me a long time to figure out. For example, I coded a Flutter application that can display a chart generated from an Influx DB on my server. And it took me a few days to figure out how it works because I had to learn the new flux language to query data from the database.
I hope I can find the time to actively contribute to this blog and improve my English on the way.
