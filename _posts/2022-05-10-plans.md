I wrote a hand full post now. And as of now, I’m happy with them. I have a lot of stories and thoughts to tell and a few topics that I can teach you all. Here are a few topics I want to cover:
1.	Flutter, more
2.	Python, add documentation for the Projects I’ve done…
3.	Linux, Server, Virtualisation, Firewall, and so on…
4.	Depression and how some of the common mental health issues in this community…
5.	A bit of reverse engineering
6.	And lots more :)

I hope you have a wonderful day. And just remember you are an amazing human being.
