Ok, we never can say something is 100% true. Our mind is a network that contains points that are connected. If two points are stronger connected, we remember something clearer. And vice versa. If its sounds like an AI or a Neuronal Network it’s because it is, just a few billion times faster and more complex and it’s built on biochemical reactions instead of silicon.

The Problem: These things just give us a more likely or a less likely not a true or false. You can notice this if you get older  you forget some things and aren’t quite sure if something really happened.

Now I say: we can’t prove that something happened without Objects: Because of the rules I mentioned above, we can’t be sure something happened. Unless other people say that too.

But what if we experienced all the same thing, our brains remember the same thing but there was no such thing? It could be possible that our brain saved the memory wrong, but because all our brains work the same way we still all remember “correctly”.

Well, it’s pretty brain f0ck. But if you ask yourself such questions you end up at such a point.

Let’s take it a step further, let us assume our world is infinite, could another human-like species produce the same World we live in today? Or do they “interpret” the things around them in another way. And even interpreter key things like thinking in another way? Well, we don’t know.
Let’s assume that all of it was a programming function, and we could change the “interpretation factor” as a parameter. Then generate infinite Worlds with infinite different parameters. Then we would have a one-dimensional infinite world generation.

Now I don’t know how I came to this point and how to close it off.

I think the many-worlds theory would be an explanation that would work in this case. There would be a starting point where all World would be generated with all infinite parameters with infinite values. But this would mean does this happen at the start or is it a continuous process? I think this is one of the smaller problems. To sum up we would live in a Matrix-like world with something other somewhere that has all infinite clones.

These are all theories, nothing is proven. I write this to give another perspective on the things we consider normal.
