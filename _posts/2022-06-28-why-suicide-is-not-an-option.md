# Why suicide is not an option!

Let’s speak facts, suicide is becoming a bigger and bigger problem in the developed world. And suicide is one of the highest causes of death among teenagers. It’s a topic no one wants to speak about. Clear numbers and statistics are hard to get and the ones for the current years aren’t even out yet. The corona pandemic has worsened a lot. Psychiatry got overflowed with teenagers who lost their contact with friends and so also their only hope.

But why would I cover this here, on a developer blog? Well, there are a few reasons. First, I can write over the stuff I want, second, it’s a big problem inside the developer world and third, we influence it.  So let me explain:

Depressions and anxiety are surprisingly common in the tech world and the MINT scene. One example is imposter syndrome. It’s easy to ignore compliments and this sort of stuff. Because you see others around you who are a thousand times better than you. And after a while, you become anxious because you think that the people around you might have too high hopes. I personally often find myself in such a situation. I once landed in a few newspapers because I reported a bypass of well-known software and somehow the story got to the media. For me, it was a “hard” time.

But why would you write over your problems? Wouldn’t that make you more vulnerable? Yes, at the beginning it makes you more vulnerable, but if you want to face your fears and tell others about them, it makes you stronger! It’s like open-source code, if you have your problems open others can learn from them and they can help you solve them better. And well smooth like this we reached the in my opinion worst point. A big reason for the high depression rate is that the secure key points broke, for example, good connections to friends and deep talks with them over all sorts of problems. From my “experience”, teens who self-harm themselves are often afraid to contact older people because they react completely unprepared. And unfortunately, I have to say yes. They often get left alone because no one knows and cares what to do. In this case from my experience, they often need someone to talk with. But make sure to not go too far! Don’t dig too deep! And make sure to tell them about your problems. Because they must see that they are not alone. Then you should tell them to get in touch with a professional therapist. There are nowadays good, free and anonym offerings! A big problem is Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok! They have an enormous impact on the feelings of teenagers. On these platforms, you see the filtered reality. And only the best parts. It’s completely not in balance! Often posts which cover such topics as depression get shadow band because you don’t want to cover such topics. And this “security” mechanism completely misses its intended purpose. It just drives the teenager’s depression. But the biggest problem is: It’s lucrative that way. Therefore, we need communities on Discord, Reddit and occasionally 4Chan, where you can anonymously post your stories and find other which have the same problems as you have.

All in all, it’s a bit sad that every 11 minutes someone dies because of suicide. I hope in the future everyone can talk about their problems regardless of their gender, social status, or their age. And why is it so strange (at least where I am) when boys hug each other especially when girls do it all the time? In my opinion, hugs are the depression killer number one regardless of gender. I sometimes have so many questions about this society.

If you are still here, thank you. If you are in a dark mood today, just know you are not alone. And a lot of the time music can help. Here are some recommendations:
