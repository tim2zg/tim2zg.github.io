# The two types of progress.

I think there are two types of progress. The invisible and the visible. The invisible is the one where you spent hours and hours on it to understand a topic, but don’t get it. And the visible one is if you finish a milestone in one of your projects. So, some examples: I have some unknown smart home thingis at home and you wanted to control them with my own software. I tried for over a year and it wouldn’t work. But in this time that you waste you get a much deeper understanding of the things you are working with. And at some point, it just works. I think it’s really important to mix and match projects. That you have the good and the bad moments as well. And in the end, it should balance. For example, I don’t have an idea about machine learning, but I want to learn it. And yes, it’s frustrating to start (at least for me). Because I could use the time on other projects, and I would be so much faster. So, I currently must switch from machine learning to some other project and back again.

Well, I hope it helped you or something. Have a good evening.
