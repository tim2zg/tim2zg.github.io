I’m addicted to YouTube. And it’s not necessarily a bad thing, because I get about 90% of my Information from YouTube.  Last month I stumbled upon a video that got recommended to me. It was about a college professor arguing about cheating (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMloyp6NI4E). And I found it interesting because what you essentially do with cheating is cut a few corners to raise your overall score. And I think there is nothing wrong whit cheating at this point. Because the only thing you’ve done is optimize the work. The problem is at another point. Your performance score is too high. And people are ranking your work and performance with your score. Essentially you get overwhelmed with work and you must again cut some corners. But if you cut corners the quality of your work goes down. And eventually, if you do it again and again you cut the wrong corners…
So, you can choose: Do you want to cheat and “fake it till you make it” or do you want to be fair and get ranked lower but deliver good and consistent work without cutting corners.
At the end of the day, you must choose for yourself. There are always ways to cheat, and I think it’s extremely easy to cheat in classes at least there where I am.
